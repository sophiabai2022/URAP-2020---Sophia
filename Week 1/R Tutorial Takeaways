# R Tutorial Takeaway

I think the tutorial is very useful for conceptual understanding of what R shiny is, 
but some resources that the video mentioned were more helpful for me to create my own shiny App.
I will summarize all the useful resources which I found useful while building my own shiny App below.

1. Shiny tutorial: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/ 
                   --> build conceptual understanding of the shiny
2. Shiny tutorial slides: https://datascienceplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/How-to-start-with-ShinyR.pdf 
                   --> easy going back and forth, efficiently look up specific notes 
3. Shiny user showcase and demos: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#user-showcase
                   --> let you review other's R code and shiny app; very helpful when I was building my own app
4. R "datasets" package: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html
                   --> contain descriptions of datasets in R package; 
                   --> google "name + R" can give you the data name to play around with the shiny app
